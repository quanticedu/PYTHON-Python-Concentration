    """Removes invalid scores.

    Removes scores that aren't in the interval [min_score, max_score]. If
    min_score > max_score, the returned list will be empty.

    Args:
        scores: An iterable of numeric data (int or float).
        min_score: The minimum score (inclusive) to include, as an int 
            or float.
        max_score: The maximum score (inclusive) to include, as an int 
            or float.

    Returns:
        A new list with valid scores. The scores argument isn't changed.

    Raises:
        TypeError: The data in scores isn't all numeric and/or min_score
            or max_score aren't numeric. This is also raised if scores
            isn't iterable.

# Notes on this docstring:
#     The detailed description should include the criteria by which a
#     score is retained or eliminated.
#
#     The Args: and Returns: sections should specify the data type of
#     all inputs and outputs of the function. If an input or output
#     can be different types, the docstring should say so. In this
#     function, scores can be any iterable (list, set, or tuple),
#     so the docstring should state so. Args is also the place to state
#     the permissible values for each arg.
#
#     You should anticipate what types of exceptions your function might
#     raise. Users will call your function with all sorts of crazy
#     inputs, so use your imagination and try to anticipate how your
#     function might break.
