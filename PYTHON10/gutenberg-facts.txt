Johannes Gutenberg was born in Mainz sometime between 1393 and 1406. He died in 1468.
While he wasn't the first to invent moveable type, his innovations in material and molds allowed type to be made quickly and durably.
His most famous printed work was the so-called Gutenberg Bible, which he produced in 1455 and sold for the equivalent of three weeks wages...a substantial improvement over the cost of hand-copied manuscripts.
